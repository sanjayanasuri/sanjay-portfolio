A curated digital garden for sharing technical experiments, visual artifacts, and moments of resonance. This site serves as a central hub for my work in data science, autonomous systems, and knowledge representation.

### 🌿 The Site
- **Gallery**: A masonry flow of technical captures and experiments in form.
- **For Friends**: A collection of things I'm currently into — records, videos, and articles.
- **Projects**: A look into my work with Brain Web and other autonomous tools.
- **Writing**: Reflections on graph theory, system foundations, and data science.

### 🛠 Tech
Built with **Next.js 14**, styled with **Vanilla CSS** (for that precision feel), and powered by **Notion** as a headless CMS. It uses a custom image proxy to ensure all Notion-hosted media is permanently linkable and cached.

### 🚀 Running Locally

If you're cloning this for your own use:

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Notion credentials.
3. **Dev Mode**: `npm run dev`

Detailed setup guides for the Notion databases can be found in the `/docs` folder.
